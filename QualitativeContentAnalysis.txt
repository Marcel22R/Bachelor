Qualitative Content Analysis is a research method for the subjective interpretation of the content of text data by trying to find patterns and common themes.

Any qualitative data reduction and  sense-making effort that takes a volume of qualitative material and tries to boil it down into its essential parts. It attempts to identify core consitstencies and meanings.

Some words on quantitative content analysis:
Quantitative content analysis is about random samples and probabilistic methods.


Qualitative content analysis differs from quantitative content analysis by using purposively selected text to inform the research question.
Quantitative approach produces numbers that are manipulated by various statistical methods. Qualitative approach produces descriptions and reflections from the subjects that show how they view the social world. (1)

6. Next the type of analysis is chosen (summary/explanation/structurisation). Based on this the next steps of interpretation are chosen. Main goal is to find a system of categories
7. Units of analysis are chosen. (Units of code, Units of context and units of evaluation)
